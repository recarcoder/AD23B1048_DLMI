**sauvola vs niblack**


Niblack thresholding was more sensitive to local intensity variations and successfully detected most thin and low-contrast vessels. However, this high sensitivity also resulted in significant noise.

Sauvola thresholding produced cleaner and more stable vessel structures with reduced noise. However, it missed many thin and weak vessels.

Attempts to reduce noise in Niblack by adjusting parameters or increasing smoothing led to loss of fine vessel structures, demonstrating trade-off between sensitivity and noise suppression.
